Declaring a variable
When we declare a variable, we should also specify what type of variable it is. This is known as data type, basically meaning what type of data we are going to store in a variable. Each data type has a specific size in memory and a range of values that it can represent.

Here are all the major data types and what they store in Java:

Data Type	Description	Example Declaration
int	Stores whole numbers	int c = 100000;
long	Stores big whole numbers	long d = 100000L;
float	Stores small decimal numbers	float e = 10.5;
double	Stores big decimal numbers	double f = 10.5;
char	Stores single characters	char g = 'A';
boolean	true or false value	boolean h = true;
String	Stores text (a sequence of characters)	String i = "Hello";

Arithmetic Operations
We can also perform basic mathematical operations with numbers.

int a = 6;
int b = 3;
Use + for addition:

  System.out.println(a + b); // prints 9
Use - for subtraction:

  System.out.println(a - b); // prints 3
Use * for multiplication:

  System.out.println(a * b); // prints 18
Use / (forward slash) for division:

  System.out.println(a / b); // prints 2
Use % (percent symbol, called modulo operator) for the division remainder:

  System.out.println(a % b); // prints 0 as 6 is evenly divisible by 3
Use ++ for increasing the value of a variable by 1:

  a++;
  System.out.println(a); // prints 7
Use -- for decreasing the value of a variable by 1:

  b--;
  System.out.println(b); // prints 2
