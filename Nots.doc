Declaring a variable
When we declare a variable, we should also specify what type of variable it is. This is known as data type, basically meaning what type of data we are going to store in a variable. Each data type has a specific size in memory and a range of values that it can represent.

Here are all the major data types and what they store in Java:

Data Type	Description	Example Declaration
int	Stores whole numbers	int c = 100000;
long	Stores big whole numbers	long d = 100000L;
float	Stores small decimal numbers	float e = 10.5;
double	Stores big decimal numbers	double f = 10.5;
char	Stores single characters	char g = 'A';
boolean	true or false value	boolean h = true;
String	Stores text (a sequence of characters)	String i = "Hello";

Arithmetic Operations
We can also perform basic mathematical operations with numbers.

int a = 6;
int b = 3;
Use + for addition:

  System.out.println(a + b); // prints 9
Use - for subtraction:

  System.out.println(a - b); // prints 3
Use * for multiplication:

  System.out.println(a * b); // prints 18
Use / (forward slash) for division:

  System.out.println(a / b); // prints 2
Use % (percent symbol, called modulo operator) for the division remainder:

  System.out.println(a % b); // prints 0 as 6 is evenly divisible by 3
Use ++ for increasing the value of a variable by 1:

  a++;
  System.out.println(a); // prints 7
Use -- for decreasing the value of a variable by 1:

  b--;
  System.out.println(b); // prints 2

Logical Operators
Logical operators help you combine multiple conditions to check if they are true or false. They are often used to make decisions based on multiple criteria.

Basic Logical Operations
Here are the basic logical operators and their usage:

&&   (Logical AND: returns true only if both conditions are true)
a > 5 && a < 10  // returns true only if a is greater than 5 but less than 10
||  (Logical OR: returns true if at least one condition is true)
a > 10 || a < 5  // returns true if a is greater than 10 or less than 5
!   (Logical NOT: reverses the result of the condition)
!(a > 5 && a < 10) // returns true in the opposite cases of the first condition above
